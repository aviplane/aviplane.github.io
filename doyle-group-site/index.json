(MOT) and then transferring these molecules to an optical trap for further cooling. Interesting later experiments could involve studying atom-molecule or molecule-molecule collisions, as well as using the ultracold sample of diatomic molecules for quantum simulation and quantum computation, or a path finder for precision measurement experiments.\nLoading Molecules The first step of this experiment is to load a magneto-optical trap (MOT) with the diatomic radical calcium monofluoride (CaF) using a buffer-gas beam source (for details on buffer-gas cells see [1-3]). We first ablate a solid precursor of atomic Ca with a pulsed Nd:YAG laser. We simultaneously flow sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) into the buffer-gas cell, leading to a chemical reaction which produces CaF. The hot molecular gas then thermalizes with ~1 K Helium buffer-gas and is extracted into a beam. The molecular beam has an average forward velocity of 50-60 m/s out of our two-stage cell. While such velocities are low enough to load conventional atomic MOTs (see our previous work on lanthanide atoms), the estimated capture velocity for a MOT of CaF is less than 10 m/s. A slowing stage is thus required to bring a sufficient number of molecules to below the capture velocity. We use a slowing technique for this beam deceleration, as was demonstrated in our recent paper [14]. An additional challenge to trapping molecules is the existence of magnetic dark states in molecules, which arise due to the fact that we trap the molecules on a transition with “inverted” angular momentum structure. We address this problem by switching the polarization and the magnetic field of the MOT very rapidly (~1 MHz) to depopulate those dark states (so called RF MOT). Finally, over a million molecules are loaded into the MOT.\nb\n","date":1752537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1752537600,"objectID":"67f845e374e3681dfe218c91b9956a7c","permalink":"https://avikar.net/doyle-group-site/project/caf/","publishdate":"2025-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/caf/","section":"project","summary":"CaF","tags":null,"title":"CaF - Quantum Simulation and Information with Diatomic Molecules","type":"project"},{"authors":["Z.

Molecules are more challenging to cool than atoms due to their vibrational and rotational internal degrees of freedom. Molecular rotations lead to the use of type-II transitions ($F\\geq F'$) for magneto-optical trapping (MOT). When typical red detuned light frequencies are applied to these transitions, sub-Doppler heating is induced, resulting in higher temperatures and larger molecular cloud sizes than realized with the type-I MOTs most often used with atoms. To improve type-II MOTs, Jarvis et al (2018 Phys. Rev. Lett. 120 083201) proposed a blue-detuned MOT to be applied after initial cooling and capture with a red-detuned MOT. This was successfully implemented (Burau et al 2023 Phys. Rev. Lett. 130 193401; Jorapur et al 2024 Phys. Rev. Lett. 132 163403; Li et al 2024 Phys. Rev. Lett. 132 233402), realizing colder and denser molecular samples. Very recently, Hallas et al (2024 arXiv:2404.03636) demonstrated a blue-detuned MOT with a '1+2' configuration that resulted in even stronger compression of the molecular cloud. Here, we describe and characterize theoretically the conveyor-belt mechanism that underlies this observed enhanced compression. We perform numerical simulations of the conveyor-belt mechanism using both stochastic Schrödinger equation and optical Bloch equation approaches. We investigate the conveyor-belt MOT characteristics in relation to laser parameters, $g$-factors and the structure of the molecule, and find that conveyor-belt trapping should be applicable to a wide range of laser-coolable molecules.","tags":["caoh"],"title":"Conveyor-belt magneto-optical trapping of molecules","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

SiPMs with large detection area have recently become commercially available, enabling applications where the photon flux is low both temporarily and spatially. On the other hand, several drawbacks exist in the usage of SiPMs such as a higher dark count rate, many readout channels, slow response time, and optical crosstalk; therefore, users need to carefully consider the trade-offs. This work presents a SiPM-embedded compact large-area photon detection module. Various techniques are adopted to overcome the disadvantages of SiPMs so that it can be generally utilized as an upgrade from a PMT. A simple cooling component and recently developed optical crosstalk suppression method are adopted to reduce the noise which is more serious for larger-area SiPMs. A dedicated readout circuit increases the response frequency and reduces the number of readout channels. We favorably compare this design with a conventional PMT and obtain both higher photon detection efficiency and larger-area acceptance.","tags":[],"title":"High-sensitivity low-noise photodetector using large-area silicon photomultiplier","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The most precise limit on the size of the electron’s electric dipole moment (eEDM), $|d_e| \u0026lt; 1.1 × 10^{−29}$e cm at 90% confidence, was set by the 2nd generation of our ACME collaboration in 2018.

We are currently working on a series of upgrades for a next generation advanced ACME experiment. These upgrades feature a hexapole molecular lens to boost the EDM signal by almost 20 times using the metastable Q state of the Thorium Monoxide (ThO) molecules, a 4 times longer spin coherence time than previously used, about 2 times high quantum efficiency in detection by using the silicon photomultiplier, suppression of excess noise present in the last generation measurement, and many more. With all these demonstrated upgrades, we are looking forward to improving our electron EDM sensitivity by another order of magnitude in the coming months. So, stay tuned!\nThe ACME experiment uses a cryogenic molecular beam of the heavy polar molecule ThO to measure the electron’s electric dipole moment (EDM). The existence of an electron EDM would manifest itself as very small energy shifts in certain molecular states when the molecules are in an electric field. The electron EDM is a strong probe of physics beyond the Standard Model.\nThe molecular beam is created by buffer gas cooling an ablated sample of ThO, which then flows out of an orifice. The molecules enter a magnetically shielded vacuum chamber that contains uniform electric and magnetic fields. We optically pump the molecules into the “H” electronic (EDM sensitive) state, and then polarize them by optically pumping undesired polarizations out of the H state. The molecules then precess in the fields, and we read out the accumulated phase with polarized lasers. By reversing the electric field, we can reverse the amount of precession accumulated from the electron EDM; taking the difference between these two phases yields the electron EDM.\nThis idea is the basis for any permanent EDM search, whether it is for atoms, neutrons, or electrons, however our experiment has several features that enhance our sensitivity:\nPolar Molecule. Polar molecules have the highest known sensitivity to an electron electric dipole moment. The electric field inside a polar molecule can be as large as tens of gigavolts per centimeter, almost a million times larger than any controlled field that can be created in a laboratory. Because the energy of a dipole moment in an electric field is proportional to the field strength, the electrons orbiting a polar molecule can experience these large fields and give proportionally larger energy shift. The electric field in ThO has been calculated to be 84 GV/cm, one of the largest known. Internal Co-magnetometer. Since we measure tiny energy splittings, a small stray electric or magnetic field can could destroy our signal. Even worse, these stray fields could look like an EDM in certain situations, for example from leakage currents between the electric field plates. Our molecule has a parity doublet: two close-lying (a few hundred kilohertz in zero field) states of opposite parity in the ground rotational level of the H state. In addition to allowing complete polarization of the molecule in very weak fields, the two components of this doublet have equal yet opposite shifts from an electron EDM. In other words, the two different doublet states correspond to spectroscopically reversing the internal electric field experienced by the electron. Therefore, we can perform our field reversal without reversing any external fields, which will give us very powerful rejection of systematic errors. Other limiting systematics, such as geometric phases, can also be eliminated because they do not reverse between populating the different doublets. Cryogenic Beam Source. Our hydrodynamically-enhanced buffer gas cooled beam is high flux, cold, and slow. We produce beams of ThO with time-averaged fluxes of over 10^13 molecules/state/sr/second moving with a forward velocity of 170 m/s, without the need for stark or optical deceleration.`` ","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"835a8bc10904b05d4a7356ec0edc714c","permalink":"https://avikar.net/doyle-group-site/project/acme/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/acme/","section":"project","summary":"The most precise limit on the size of the electron’s electric dipole moment (eEDM), $|d_e| \u003c 1.1 × 10^{−29}$e cm at 90% confidence, was set by the 2nd generation of our ACME collaboration in 2018.

The use of laser radiation to control and cool external and internal degrees of freedom has revolutionized atomic, molecular, and optical physics [1]. The powerful techniques of laser cooling and trapping using light scattering forces for atoms led to breakthroughs in both fundamental and applied sciences, including detailed studies of degenerate quantum gases and many-body physics [2,3], creation of novel frequency standards [4], and precision measurements of fundamental constants [5,6]. Polyatomic molecules are more difficult to manipulate than atoms and diatomic molecules because they possess additional rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom. Partially because of their increased complexity, cold dense samples of molecules with three or more atoms offer unique capabilities for exploring interdisciplinary frontiers in physics, chemistry and even biology. Precise control over polyatomic molecules could lead to applications in astrophysics [7], quantum simulation [8] and computation [9,10], fundamental physics [11,12], and chemistry [13]. Study of parity violation in biomolecular chirality [14]—which plays a fundamental role in molecular biology [15]—necessarily requires polyatomic molecules.\nMotivated by recent successes in the laser cooling and trapping of diatomic molecules [16-20], as well as recent demonstrations in our group of laser cooling of triatomic molecules [21-24], we are currently working to load a magneto-optical trap (MOT) with the linear, triatomic molecule calcium monohydroxide (CaOH). Our approach starts with buffer gas cooling [25-27], a technique that dramatically reduces the number of populated internal rotational and vibrational states by thermalizing a sample of molecules with helium gas at ~2K. This initial cooling step is critical for working with molecules to limit the number of quantum states that have significant population, and our two-stage buffer gas cell design has additionally allowed us to produce a slow beam of CaOH molecules with a peak velocity below 100 m/s. We are now working to adapt successful atomic and diatomic laser cooling techniques to triatomic CaOH. We have recently demonstrated 1D cooling and compression of the molecular beam using a one-dimensional MOT [28]; this has allowed us to demonstrate the feasibility of scattering thousands of photons via radiative cooling and the application of magneto-optical forces, both of which will be necessary for 3D trapping. We will next radiatively slow the CaOH beam, which can be accomplished using a white-light slowing scheme [29]. We will then produce a 3D MOT using techniques similar to those demonstrated with diatomic SrF and CaF [16-18]. Unlike electronic and rotational transitions, there are no selection rules governing vibrational degrees of freedom in molecules, forcing us to rely on molecule-dependent vibrational branching ratios to avoid decay out of the cooling cycle. These have been shown to be favorable in CaOH [30], meaning that direct laser cooling and slowing should be feasible with a manageable number of repumping lasers.\nWe are additionally examining how to extend laser cooling techniques to more complex polyatomic molecules, such as symmetric tops like CaOCH3, and have identified a number of large polyatomics expected to have near-diagonal Franck-Condon factors [30, 31].\n","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"bb6378aa22e080fc5304f554231673da","permalink":"https://avikar.net/doyle-group-site/project/caoh/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/caoh/","section":"project","summary":"Research Overview The goal of this experiment is to bring polyatomic molecules into the ultracold regime using direct laser cooling. The use of laser radiation to control and cool external and internal degrees of freedom has revolutionized atomic, molecular, and optical physics [1]. The powerful techniques of laser cooling and trapping using light scattering forces for atoms led to breakthroughs in both fundamental and applied sciences, including detailed studies of degenerate quantum gases and many-body physics [2,3], creation of novel frequency standards [4], and precision measurements of fundamental constants [5,6]. Polyatomic molecules are more difficult to manipulate than atoms and diatomic molecules because they possess additional rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom. Partially because of their increased complexity, cold dense samples of molecules with three or more atoms offer unique capabilities for exploring interdisciplinary frontiers in physics, chemistry and even biology. Precise control over polyatomic molecules could lead to applications in astrophysics [7], quantum simulation [8] and computation [9,10], fundamental physics [11,12], and chemistry [13].

The octuple deformation of radium nuclei [4] is predicted to amplify both parity (P) and time-reversal (T) violating nuclear properties by more than three orders of magnitude compared to stable molecules [5, 6, 7].\nRecent results in the spectroscopy of radioactive molecules have demonstrated that radium-containing molecules, such as 225RaF and 225RaOH, additionally possess a relatively simple structure that is very favorable for laser cooling (see Fig. 1) [7, 8, 9]. This combination makes these molecules excellent quantum sensors for fundamental physics, opening the door to searches for P,T violating nuclear effects, such as the nuclear Schiff moment, manifesting as electric dipole moments (EDMs) of molecules [1, 2, 3].\nExperimental Work The roadmap to ultra-sensitive measurements with radium-containing molecules begins with the less radioactive isotope 226Ra (τ1/2 = 1600 yr), simplifying the experimental apparatus and molecule structure, and enabling rapid prototyping at university laboratories. To demonstrate the first laser cooling and trapping of a radioactive molecule, we will work with the well-characterized diatomic molecule 226RaF, which has an ideal molecular structure for laser cooling [9]. Concurrently, we will also test optical cycling (the key property that enables laser cooling) in 226RaOH, where the polyatomic structure generically provides parity doublets, a powerful structural advantage for state-of-the-art precision measurements [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Fortunately, RaF and RaOH molecules have isoelectronic structure; hence sharing common production methods and similar optical transitions, accessible with common laser technologies. Many of the initial experimental breakthroughs in RaF can pave the way for advances with RaOH, and their similarity enables changing from RaF to RaOH in an experiment with the metaphorical “flip of a switch”.\nInitially, experimental prototyping will be performed in cold (∼ K) molecular beams, an essential tool for measuring, cooling, and trapping molecules. This experiment will overcome challenges in producing and cooling 226Ra-containing molecules, establishing the path for future work to capture the molecular beam in a long-lived trap at ultracold temperatures (\u0026lt; mK). This work will establish the experimental basis for eventual enhanced hadronic symmetry violation measurements with 225Ra (τ1/2 = 14.9 d) containing molecules at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB).\nReferences [1] W.

Furthermore, with the discovery of the Higgs particle in 2012, every core prediction of the SM has been validated by experiment. Despite these successes, the SM alone cannot explain the entirety of fundamental physics. Perhaps most dramatically, astronomical observations over the last fifty years have shown that only 15% of the matter in the universe is composed of particles described by the SM. The remaining particles, which do not (or only very weakly) interact with light, are known as “dark” matter. Very little is known with certainty about the nature of dark matter.\nOne major source of evidence for dark matter is gravitational lensing (see right), where the path of light from distant galaxies is bent by the gravitational in uence of galaxies in the cosmic neighborhood of its trajectory. As a result, images of the night sky become distorted. By analyzing the distortions, it is possible to infer the positions and masses of the gravitational sources. This method produces the most accurate maps of the matter density throughout the universe. Remarkably, these maps show that all visible matter comprises only a small fraction of all matter. The difference is “dark matter,” which is gravitationally active but does not emit or absorb light. Simulations of nucleosynthesis and cosmological structure formation as well as observations of the cosmic microwave background are also consistent with a universe composed of 85% dark matter [1].\nPolyatomic molecules as dark matter sensors In many well-motivated models, cold dark matter particles behave collectively like a classical field throughout space (such as a gravitational field) [2]. Such a dark matter field would oscillate at a frequency determined by the mass of each particle. Depending on its interactions with ordinary matter, electrons and nuclei would undergo a slight change in mass that follows the oscillation of the dark matter field. Thus high-precision measurements of fundamental “constants,” such as the ratio of electron mass to prooton mass, could reveal a small time-dependence. The magnitude of this time-dependent part of the fundamental constant contains information about the interactions between dark matter and ordinary matter, while the frequency of oscillation would reveal the dark matter particle mass.\nEnergy oscillation The energies of molecular vibrations and rotations depend on the proton-to-electron mass ratio, denoted by μ: for example, increasing the proton mass (with the electron mass fixed) reduces the energy of a rotating or vibrating molecule. The fractional change in the energy of a rotating or vibrating molecule is typically the same (within a factor of two) as the fractional change in μ. However, absolute energies of individual states are not physically meaningful. Only energy differences can be measured. Certain special cases arise where the energies of two molecular states are nearly identical, but the states each have different fractional depenences on μ. In these cases, the dependence of the fractional energy difference on fractional changes in μ can be enhanced by a factor of hundreds to thousands! Oftentimes, experimental sensitivity is limited by systematic errors scaling with the absolute energy difference between two states (for example, due to technical noise sources in high-frequency radiation sources like lasers). Then, a larger fractional sensitivity of the transition can lead to a better ultimate absolute sensitivity to changes in μ. Laboratory-based dark matter detection with laser-cooled SrOH SrOH molecules were the first polyatomic molecules to be laser cooled, opening up the prospect of full quantum control over their internal states and trapping for long observation times [3]. There exists a pair of vibrational states in SrOH, namely a triply-excited bending vibration and a doubly-excited stretching vibration, with nearly the same energy but signicantly different dependences on μ. We have analyzed these states theoretically and found that a transition between them can be driven by microwave radiation, and their energy difference thereby directly measured [4]. Microwave-scale energies are more straightforwardly measured to high precision (e.g., compared to an optical-energy measurement using a frequency comb), and the small scale of the energy difference between the states suppresses potential systematic errors. We have also identied sets of rotational states in the two vibrational manifolds that are expected to have nearly-zero common-mode sensitivity to electric and magnetic fields, leading to strong suppression of common systematic errors associated with imperfect control of electromagnetic elds. With one day of integration, we expect an absolute microwave frequency sensitivity of about 3 μHz for oscillation frequencies between about 10 μHz (bounded from below by the full …","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"be4ea887c41f9980401411a67b94eaf6","permalink":"https://avikar.net/doyle-group-site/project/sroh/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sroh/","section":"project","summary":"Missing matter The current framework of fundamental physics, called the Standard Model (SM), has successfully withstood every laboratory test.

Building on the already established strong optical cycling of diatomic, linear triatomic, and symmetric top molecules, recent theoretical and experimental work has indicated that cycling will be extendable to phenol containing molecules, as well as other asymmetric species. The paradigm for these systems is the use of an optical cycling center bonded to a molecular ligand.
