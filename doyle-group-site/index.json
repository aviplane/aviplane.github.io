The ACME III electron electric dipole moment (eEDM) search experiment uses this source to produce a beam of cold, slow thorium monoxide (ThO) molecules. A key feature of the apparatus is its capability to replace ablation targets without interrupting vacuum or cryogenic conditions, increasing the average signal in the eEDM search. The source produces approximately     ground-state ThO molecules per pulse, with a rotational temperature of   K, molecular beam solid angle of   sr, and forward velocity of   m/s. These parameters match the performance of traditional sources that require time-consuming thermal cycles for target replacement. A long-term yield improvement of about 40% is achieved when the load-lock system is used to replace targets biweekly.","tags":["ACME"],"title":"A cryogenic buffer gas beam source with in-situ ablation target replacement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zack Lasner","frenett","sawaoka","Loïc Anderegg","augenbraun","H.

Inelastic collision rate constants are measured for CaOH prepared in ground and excited vibrational states, and the electric field dependence of these rates is measured for molecules in single quantum states of the parity-doubled bending mode. Theoretical calculations of collision rate coefficients are performed and found to agree with measured values. The lowest collisional loss rates are for states with repulsive long-range potentials that shield ultracold molecules from loss channels at short distance. These results unveil the collisional behavior of parity doublet molecules in the ultracold regime, and lay the foundation for future experiments to evaporatively cool polyatomic molecules to quantum degeneracy.","tags":["CaOH"],"title":"Quantum-State-Controlled Collisions of Ultracold Polyatomic Molecules","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Grace Li","Christian Hallas","John M.

Molecules are more challenging to cool than atoms due to their vibrational and rotational internal degrees of freedom. Molecular rotations lead to the use of type-II transitions ($F\\geq F'$) for magneto-optical trapping (MOT). When typical red detuned light frequencies are applied to these transitions, sub-Doppler heating is induced, resulting in higher temperatures and larger molecular cloud sizes than realized with the type-I MOTs most often used with atoms. To improve type-II MOTs, Jarvis et al (2018 Phys. Rev. Lett. 120 083201) proposed a blue-detuned MOT to be applied after initial cooling and capture with a red-detuned MOT. This was successfully implemented (Burau et al 2023 Phys. Rev. Lett. 130 193401; Jorapur et al 2024 Phys. Rev. Lett. 132 163403; Li et al 2024 Phys. Rev. Lett. 132 233402), realizing colder and denser molecular samples. Very recently, Hallas et al (2024 arXiv:2404.03636) demonstrated a blue-detuned MOT with a '1+2' configuration that resulted in even stronger compression of the molecular cloud. Here, we describe and characterize theoretically the conveyor-belt mechanism that underlies this observed enhanced compression. We perform numerical simulations of the conveyor-belt mechanism using both stochastic Schrödinger equation and optical Bloch equation approaches. We investigate the conveyor-belt MOT characteristics in relation to laser parameters, $g$-factors and the structure of the molecule, and find that conveyor-belt trapping should be applicable to a wide range of laser-coolable molecules.","tags":["caoh"],"title":"Conveyor-belt magneto-optical trapping of molecules","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

On the other hand, several drawbacks exist in the usage of SiPMs such as a higher dark count rate, many readout channels, slow response time, and optical crosstalk; therefore, users need to carefully consider the trade-offs. This work presents a SiPM-embedded compact large-area photon detection module. Various techniques are adopted to overcome the disadvantages of SiPMs so that it can be generally utilized as an upgrade from a PMT. A simple cooling component and recently developed optical crosstalk suppression method are adopted to reduce the noise which is more serious for larger-area SiPMs. A dedicated readout circuit increases the response frequency and reduces the number of readout channels. We favorably compare this design with a conventional PMT and obtain both higher photon detection efficiency and larger-area acceptance.","tags":[],"title":"High-sensitivity low-noise photodetector using large-area silicon photomultiplier","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://avikar.net/doyle-group-site/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/doyle-group-site/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":["sawaoka","frenett","Abdullah Nasir","T.

Long distance transport of molecules greatly eases fulfilling these requirements as molecules are placed into a region separate from the MOT chamber. We realize a fast transport method for ultracold molecules based on an electronically focus-tunable lens combined with an optical lattice. The high transport speed is achieved by the 1D red-detuned optical lattice, which is generated by interference of a focus-tunable laser beam and a focus-fixed laser beam.

Building on the already established strong optical cycling of diatomic, linear triatomic, and symmetric top molecules, recent theoretical and experimental work has indicated that cycling will be extendable to phenol containing molecules, as well as other asymmetric species. The paradigm for these systems is the use of an optical cycling center bonded to a molecular ligand.
